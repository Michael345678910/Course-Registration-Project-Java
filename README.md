# Course-Registration-Project-Java
This course registration project was made in Java utilizing JPanel to help visualize the project has multiple folders within the src folder used to build the program. It separates the course registration project between four main folders and the start program source file. It separates them into a controller folder, a model folder, a test folder, and a view folder. These are all used to simulate a real student going through as if they are attempting to register for a course within a college from the very beginning.
